Python program -> Python Interpreter compiles it into byte code(Python specific intermediate code) stored in .pyc file under __pycache__ -> PVM executes the byte code line by line.
.pyc file : contains the byte code.(Not for top-level files)
__pycache__ : dir that maintains source changes, .pyc files and libs.
Python version :
- cPython : Interpreter written in c.
- Jython : Interpreter in java.
- Similarly PyPy, IronPython also exists with different compatibilities and performance.

Basic Picture:
.py file -(Python Interpreter Compilation)-> byte_code(.pyc file) -PVM-> executes code line-by-line
